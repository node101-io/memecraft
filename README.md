## Our Experience with Chopin Framework
During the development of MemeCraft, we integrated the Chopin Framework for ensuring verification.

One of the initial issues we faced was that the Oracle function did not accept arguments. This was a critical limitation for our use case since we implement all the POST requests with Oracle. We needed a more dynamic approach. We reached out to **LZRS**, and a fix was implemented to improve Oracle flexibility.

For authentication, we first used the **cookie method** that Chopin Framework offers, but since the mini app is running inside an **iframe**, cookie usage was limited. So, we migrated to **JWT authentication**, which Chopin also offers.

## Challenges & Solutions

### AI-Powered Meme Generation Without Compromising User Experience
One of the core features envisioned for MemeCraft was an **AI-driven meme generator** that could analyze the last 100 messages in a chat and dynamically create a meme based on the conversation.

However, we found that accessing chat history required a bot to be present in the conversation. This raised privacy concerns‚ÄîMemeCraft was designed to be effortless and fun, and requiring users to add a bot to their private chats could feel intrusive.

As a decentralized sovereign rollup, we chose not to compromise on user privacy or impose unnecessary friction. Instead, we explored alternative approaches that would allow MemeCraft to generate memes seamlessly without requiring intrusive permissions or centralized data access.

### Solution: A Privacy-First, Mini App Experience
‚úÖ **No Bots, No Intrusion** ‚Äì We prioritized user privacy and opted to build MemeCraft as a **Telegram Mini App** instead of a bot, ensuring users can create memes without needing to add a bot to their personal chats.

‚úÖ **Seamless & Fun** ‚Äì Users can still quickly describe their meme or let AI suggest one, keeping the experience smooth and intuitive, without the friction of bot permissions.

‚úÖ **Gossip-Friendly Design** ‚Äì Whether you're spilling tea with your best friend or having a private conversation, MemeCraft stays out of your chat‚Äîso you can meme freely without an AI bot lurking in the background.

This decision keeps MemeCraft **fun, lightweight, and privacy-friendly**, ensuring effortless meme creation without disrupting personal conversations.

### Telegram Mini App Limitations

#### Challenge: Optimizing User Experience in Telegram Mini App Display Modes
Telegram Mini Apps offer two display modes:
1. **Mini App Window** ‚Äì A full-screen experience inside Telegram.
2. **Inline Helper** ‚Äì A compact interface displayed directly above the keyboard, allowing seamless interaction while messaging.

Our initial approach was to make MemeCraft available in the **Inline Helper**, providing users with a fast and easy way to create memes within conversations. However, MemeCraft‚Äôs reliance on **the Chopin framework for blockchain interactions** introduced constraints, making it difficult to deliver a full-featured experience in the Inline Helper.

#### Solution: Seamless Transition Between Mini App and Inline Helper
- **Core Features in the Mini App** ‚Äì Users can now access AI-powered meme generation, NFT minting, and meme discovery within the full Telegram Mini App for a smoother and more powerful experience.
- **Inline Helper for Quick Access** ‚Äì To keep convenience in messaging, we still allow users to access their meme inventory through the Inline Helper, making it easy to share and use memes instantly.

This approach balances usability with functionality, ensuring effortless meme creation and minting without disrupting the user experience.

### Challenge: Web App Button Visibility on Telegram iOS
During development, we encountered an unexpected platform-specific limitation‚Äîon **iOS Telegram clients**, the **web_app button** in **inline query results** does not appear when using `InlineQueryResultGif` or `InlineQueryResultPhoto`.

This was a significant usability issue because the button works flawlessly on **Telegram Web** and **Android**, but on iOS, users couldn't easily access the MemeCraft web app directly from inline query results.

#### Solution: Reporting & Seeking a Fix
‚úÖ Opened an Official Issue ‚Äì We documented and reported the issue to Telegram‚Äôs development team to seek a resolution. (You can track the issue [here](https://github.com/TelegramMessenger/Telegram-iOS/issues/1687))

By staying proactive, we aim to ensure seamless meme creation across all Telegram platforms, delivering the same frictionless experience to iOS, Android, and Web users alike. üöÄ
